1.Create a executable file by 'Echo -n superSecretPassword > password.txt' and 'clang -g -O0 -fno-stack-protector -fomit-frame-pointer -Wl,-no_pie login.c'.

2.The password is stored at most 32 bytes. So we could overflow the buffer and get the return address of login because the password is stored at most 32 bytes.

3.Run the executable file. The shell shows "successful login" and it begins to run.

4.Disassemble and redirect to disassembled.s.

5.Use 'lldb' to check the return address which we would like to replace.

6.Run the command "python -c 'print "a"*40 + "\x80\x0e\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00", password.txt'". Because the correct return address is 0x0000000100000e80, we could overwrite data at this address.

7.Run this executable file again and we could successfully login without correct password.
